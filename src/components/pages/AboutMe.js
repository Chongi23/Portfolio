            <p> Hello, my name is Krysta Gonzalez , I am currently a Full Stack Web Development student enrolled in UTSA's fullstack bootcamp 
                program. I have learned a lot in the past six months and am so happy to have found this experience that sparked a fire in me to 
                further pursue this career path, I know one day I will become a senior fullstack web developer, but in the shorter future, I hope it to
                be junior web developer. The projects shown will demonstrate my current progress with this career choice. Each project has a repo link for 
                further inspection, if one is interested.
            </p>
            <p>Before diving into this career path , I have spent many years working in the service industry. This type of field has made my
                communication and customer service skills very sharp. I work with teams quite often for large events and handle high paced 
                environments calmly, my problem solving skills are always sharp, and I am kept on my toes.
            </p>
            <p> I enjoy running along the river , reading, and spending time with my dogs, learning as much as I can and loving life are 
                two big goals for me.
            </p>
